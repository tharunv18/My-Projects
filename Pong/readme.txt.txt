In this assignment i improved Pong by making it possible for each player to use an ability sich that they can double the height of their paddle for a turn.
I also made the game end once a player reaches 10 points.
I also added an instructions button so the users can understand the game they are playing.
Lastly, I made the ball speed up each time it is hit by a paddle but resets to the original speed once the next turn begins.
